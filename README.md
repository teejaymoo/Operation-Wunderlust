# Operation-Wunderlust

Welcome to Wunderlust!


## The Objective

This full-stack web app is used to track all of the places you've been or desire to go.
You will be able to leave notes on each logs you've made, you can update and also delete any of the logs you've made.


Various technologies will be used to make this poosible; jQuery, Bootstrap, Javascript, HTML/CSS(SASS), along with a built API by yours truly.



## Design details:
The front page will be simple, displaying 2 tab on a central container, one for signing up and on for logging in.
The main page will have a whole section of all the logs made by the user, and also a section to generate the logs.

## Unsolved problems

Not so much as unsolved, much more as out of scope and dreaming high. I will evenetually want to implement
the ability to add pictures. I also want to the users to be able to view other users notes and logs of different cities they have been.
